This is a placeholder for the sprite sheet image.

To generate the actual sprite sheet:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/sprite-generator.html in your browser
2. Click 'Generate Sprite Sheet'
3. Once generated, click 'Download Sprite Sheet'
4. Save the downloaded image as 'robot-sprite.png' in the '/public/assets/' directory

Alternatively, you can use an image editing tool to create a sprite sheet by arranging all robot images in a 5x5 grid.
